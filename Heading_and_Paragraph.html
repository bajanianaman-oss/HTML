        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure web pages.
        It provides the basic framework for websites by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
        CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is used alongside HTML to control the appearance and layout of web pages.
        With CSS, you can change colors, fonts, spacing, and even create responsive designs that look good on any device.
        Java is a widely-used programming language known for its portability, reliability, and security.
        It is often used to build large-scale applications, mobile apps, and games. Python is another popular programming language, valued for its simplicity and readability.
        It is commonly used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.
        Together, HTML, CSS, Java, and Python form a strong foundation for anyone interested in learning about technology and software development.
